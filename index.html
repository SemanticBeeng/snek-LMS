                Even as deep learning techniques become more and more well-understood, neural network architectures grow increasingly sophisticated and diverse seemingly every day. This has caused a swell of interest in deep learning (and programming at large), though many potential researchers find themselves dismayed at the lack of tools which are both efficient and expressive. Indeed, for many, it seems impossible to have the best of both worlds!

                <span class="blue-text">Lantern</span> is a new, highly expressive, framework for deep learning developed at Purdue University, written entirely in Scala. Lantern utilizes delimited continuations and shift/reset constructs for extremely high-level coding while generating C++ code at runtime to avoid sacrificing performance.
